Approximately 87% of adults in the UK see outdoor advertising each week.</p><p>Many of Dorset’s roundabout sponsors have increased the number of roundabouts they sponsor each year, proving that outdoor advertising on roundabouts works well for their businesses. We’ve many positive testimonials from customers, citing growth in their businesses from this form of advertising, and over two-thirds of sponsors renew their roundabouts every year – providing us with the feedback that they are getting a good return on their sponsorship and advertising spend.</p>",
